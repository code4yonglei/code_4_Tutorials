# Chapter 13: K-Means

Previous chapters, we discussed supervised learning tasks, examined algorithms for regression and classification that learned from labeled training data.

This chapter, we introduce our first unsupervised learning task: clustering.
- clustering is used to find groups of similar observations within a set of unlabeled data
- we discuss K-means clustering algorithm, apply it to an image compression problem, and learn to measure its performance
- we work through a semi-supervised learning problem that combines clustering with classification
