# Chapter 7: Naive Bayes


Previous chapters introduced two models for classification tasks: kNN and logistic regression.
- here introduce another family of classifiers called Naive Bayes
- named for its use of Bayes' theorem and for its naive assumption that all features are conditionally independent of each other given response variable, Naive Bayes is 1st generative model to discuss
	- 1st introduce Bayes' theorem
	- 2nd compare generative and discriminative models
		- we will discuss Naive Bayes and its assumptions and examine its common variants
		- we will fit a model using scikit-learn
