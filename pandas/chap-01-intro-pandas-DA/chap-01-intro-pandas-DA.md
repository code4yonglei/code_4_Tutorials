# Chap. 1: Introduction to pandas and Data Analysis

This chapter covers context, origin, history, market share, and current standing of pandas, and are divided into the following headers:
- Motivation for data analysis
- How Python and pandas can be used for data analysis
- Description of the pandas library
- Benefits of using pandas


## 1. Motivation for data analysis

The term big data has become one of the hottest technology buzzwords in past two years.
- we now increasingly hear about big data in various media outlets, and big data startups have increasingly been attracting venture capital.
- loosely speaking, big data refers to a phenomenon wherein amount of data exceeds capability of recipients of data to process it.
- an article on big data: https://www.oracle.com/in/big-data/guide/what-is-big-data.html

A good way to start thinking about complexities of big data is called four dimensions, or **Four V's of big data**
- this model was first introduced as three V's by Gartner analyst Doug Laney in 2001
	- three V's stood for Volume, Velocity, and Variety
	- Gartner's official definition states following *Big data is high volume, high velocity, and/or high variety information assets that require new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making, insight discovery and process optimization* -- Laneh, Douglas. "The Importance of 'Big Data': A Definition", Gartner
- fourth V, Veracity, was added later by IBM

Volume of big data
- volume of data in big data age is simply mind-boggling
- according to IBM, by 2020, total amount of data on planet will have ballooned to 40 zettabytes
- growth rate of data has been fuelled largely by a few factors, such as rapid growth of internet, conversion from analog to digital media, coupled with an increased ability to capture and store data, which in turn has been made possible with cheaper and better storage technology

Velocity of big data
- from a purely technological point of view, velocity refers to throughput of big data, or how fast data is coming in and is being processed
- this has ramifications on how fast recipient of data needs to process it to keep up
- real-time analytics is one attempt to handle this characteristic 

Variety of big data
- variety of big data comes from having a multiplicity of data sources that generate data and different formats of data that are produced
- this results in a technological challenge for recipients of data who have to process it
- digital cameras, sensors, web, cell phones, and so on are some data generators that produce data in differing formats, and challenge is being able to handle all these formats and extract meaningful information from these data.

Veracity of big data
- it was added laterâ€”refers to need to validate or confirm orrectness of data or fact that data represents truth
- sources of data must be verified and errors kept to a minimum

So much data, so little time for analysis
- data analytics has been described by Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, as Future of Everything.
- a YouTube video called [Why Data Analytics is the Future of Everything]()
- technologies and tools have evolved to meet the ever-increasing demands of business, there has been a move towards **real-time analytics**
